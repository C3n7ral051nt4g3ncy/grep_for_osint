GREP FOR OSINT is a set of very simple shell scripts that will help you quickly analyze a text or a folder with files for data useful for investigation (phone numbers, bank card numbers, URLs, emails and nicknames).

Simply replace the text in the "text_for_analyze.txt" file with your text and run one of the .sh files whose name ends in "from_text".

For example:

bash Email_from_text.sh

Or replace the files in the "files_for_analyze" folder with your own and run one of the .sh files ending in "from_folder".

The result will be saved in a new text file with an appropriate name (for example, result_email_from_text_2021.08.01-16.47.52).

-------------------------------

*Warning*

With large amounts of text the grep command can take a very, very long time.
